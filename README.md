# Ad Relevance Scoring

This project explores how to evaluate the relevance and quality of online ads based on a search query. It reflects my experience as an Ads Assessor, where I had to judge ads by usefulness, accuracy, and compliance.

The repo shows an end-to-end mini pipeline:
1. Load and clean a small ads dataset
2. Explore basic patterns
3. Create simple text features
4. Train a baseline model to predict relevance
5. Evaluate the model

## Dataset

A small synthetic dataset is included in data/sample_ads.csv.

## Tech stack

- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  

## How to run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install requirements  
3. Run the notebook in notebooks/

## Goals

- Demonstrate data cleaning  
- Explore simple patterns  
- Build a baseline model  
- Communicate results clearly# ad-relevance-scoring
